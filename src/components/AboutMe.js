    <h1 class="card-title text-3xl">Bio</h1>
    <p>Transcending into America at the ripe age of five I grew up with a diverse family background with a love of all things living. After throttling deep into the animal kingdom during my early years, I grew passionate about human interactions and connections during college. During this time, I sought out opportunites to help use my current skills to develop good leaders by ackowledging my strenghts and seeking further ways to develop my future goals. After being in the food industry for 7 years in management, I took an appreciation to all the programs available in my day to day  and became deeply intrigued by their programming. As I dove deeper I grew a better understanding and fondness for coding, which led me to change my career path and here I am now to UC Berkley Bootcamp!</p>
