        <p>
          Transcending into America at the ripe age of five I grew up with a
          diverse family background with a love of all things living. After
          throttling deep into the animal kingdom during my early years, I grew
          passionate about human interactions and connections during college.
          During this time, I sought out opportunites to help use my current
          skills to develop good leaders by ackowledging my strenghts and
          seeking further ways to develop my future goals. After being in the
          food industry for 7 years in management, I took an appreciation to all
          the programs available in my day to day and became deeply intrigued by
          their programming. As I dove deeper I grew a better understanding and
          fondness for coding, which led me to change my career path and here I
          am now to UC Berkley Bootcamp!
